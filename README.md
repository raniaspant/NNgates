# AND, OR, XOR gates using offline and online learning (Neural Network implementation)

Developed in PyCharm.

Running the scripts will produce error and weights plots. 

The scripts contain the architecture of the networks with all the layers (2 for XOR and single layer for AND and OR) without the usage of auxiliary libraries.
